\description{
For a given period of time (a day, week, or month) Revenera's API
summarizes and returns the number of active users. With this function
you can return daily, weekly, or monthly active users for multiple 
product ids.
}
\details{
You can specify a start and end date but Revenera does not store
an indefinite period of historical data. 

It is not recommended that your username be stored directly in your
code. There are various methods and packages available that are more 
secure; this package does not require you to use any one in particular.

The optional_json parameter is available so that other optional arguments
can be added to the api request. This will require the user to consult
the API documentation. See README for an example.
